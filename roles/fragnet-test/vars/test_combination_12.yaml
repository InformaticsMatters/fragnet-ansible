#Â Test results.

# Suppliers expected in the deployed database.
#
# A list. If this is empty the test playbook does not check the suppliers
# it finds in the database (other than always expected at least one supplier).
#
# If this list is set (by the user) the 'test-fragnet' play (which collects the
# list of suppliers in the database) will insist that the collected set of
# suppliers matches the provided list (order is unimportant).
fragnet_expected_suppliers:

# Availability tests.
#
# Here we provide built-in availability results for a small set of 'significant'
# molecules. For each 'molecule' we provide 'results' that are expected
# for each of the 'known suppliers' in the deployed database. If this
# set of results does not match the database you've deployed you must provide
# your own.
